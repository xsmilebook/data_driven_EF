# PROGRESS.md

Real-time development log for the refactor of `data_driven_EF`.

## Current focus

## Completed

- Expanded behavioral metrics computation documentation in `docs/methods.md`.
- Removed `RT_Mean`/`RT_SD` outputs for SST/GNG/CPT in metrics configuration and docs.
- Added a single-subject behavioral EDA entrypoint (`scripts/eda_behavior_trials.py`) and generated a per-task trial-count report under `docs/reports/`.
- Updated the behavioral EDA report to include SST Go/Stop trial counts.
