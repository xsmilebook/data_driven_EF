# Session log (2025-12-30)

Target audience: contributors and reproducibility reviewers.

Scope: documentation, directory layout, and log-path updates in submission scripts. Non-goals: no pipeline or analysis logic changes.

Changes:
- Added root directories `notebooks/` and `models/` for exploratory work and model artifacts.
- Moved `docs/report/` to `docs/reports/` and updated doc references.
- Relocated runtime logs under `outputs/<DATASET>/logs/` (removed top-level `logs/`, updated references and scripts).
- Documented `data/external/` in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
- Updated SLURM submission scripts to write logs under `outputs/EFNY/logs/`.

Notes:
- Directory structure is now reflected in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, and dataset/research docs.
