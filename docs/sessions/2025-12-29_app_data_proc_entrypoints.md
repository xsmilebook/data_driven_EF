# 2025-12-29 app_data_proc defaults and entry points

## Summary
- Added config-driven defaults for app-data processing utilities.
- Added thin `scripts/` entry points for behavioral data build, task analysis, and missing-metrics reports.
- Updated `README.md` usage for behavioral data build.

## Rationale
- Aligns app-data tools with standardized dataset/config invocation.
- Removes hard-coded EFNY output paths from reusable modules.
