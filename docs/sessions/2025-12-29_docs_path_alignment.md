# 2025-12-29 docs path alignment

## Summary
- Updated `docs/workflow.md` to document `outputs/<DATASET>` and static SBATCH log paths.
- Updated `docs/data_dictionary.md` and `docs/datasets/EFNY.md` to reflect `data/raw`, `data/interim`, `data/processed`, and `outputs` conventions.

## Rationale
- Keeps documentation aligned with the standardized path model in configs.
