# Documentation index

This directory contains human-readable documentation for the `data_driven_EF` project.

## Key files

- `docs/workflow.md`: how to run the pipeline (engineering-facing).
- `docs/methods.md`: methodological write-up (paper-facing; may be incomplete).
- `docs/data_dictionary.md`: glossary / column-level descriptions (work in progress).
- `docs/datasets/`: dataset-specific documentation (e.g., EFNY).
- `docs/report/`: research planning and summaries.

## Notes vs sessions

- `docs/sessions/`: chronological session logs (AI/development sessions).
- `docs/notes/`: user notes and free-form ideas (not a session log).

## Logs

- All runtime logs are stored under the repository root `logs/` folder.
- Organize log files by dataset and task (e.g., `logs/EFNY/real_adaptive_pls/`).
