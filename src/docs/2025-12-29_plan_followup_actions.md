# 2025-12-29 plan follow-up actions

## Summary
- Added config-driven defaults for remaining functional connectivity and behavioral metric utilities.
- Added thin `scripts/` entry points for remaining runnable modules.
- Updated README usage blocks to match standardized CLI patterns.
- Updated `docs/workflow.md` to recommend `scripts.run_*` wrappers.
- Completed py_compile checks and run_single_task dry-run.

## Rationale
- Aligns remaining tools with the centralized config and entry-point strategy.
