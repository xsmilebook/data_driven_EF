# Project Structure

This document defines the stable folder structure and responsibilities of each directory in this project.

## High-level principles
- data/ and outputs/ are runtime artifacts and are NOT version-controlled
- src/ contains reusable library code only
- scripts/ are execution entry points
- docs/ are the source of truth for methodology and decisions
- dataset-specific differences MUST be isolated under docs/datasets and configs/datasets

## Directory responsibilities

- src/
  Reusable Python modules. No hard-coded paths. No dataset-specific logic.

- scripts/
  Execution entry points. May parse config and dataset arguments.

- data/
  Raw and processed datasets. Never modified by git.

- outputs/
  Results generated by scripts. Not tracked by git.

- docs/
  Human- and AI-readable documentation.
  - workflow.md: reproducible pipeline
  - methods.md: paper-level methodology
  - datasets/: dataset-specific notes
  - report/: research planning and summaries
  - sessions/: AI/development session logs (one per session)
  - notes/: user notes and free-form ideas

## Rules for AI-assisted modification
- Do not modify data/ or outputs/
- Do not change directory names without explicit instruction
- If src/ logic changes, update docs/workflow.md accordingly
