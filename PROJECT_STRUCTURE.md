# Project Structure

This document defines the stable folder structure and responsibilities of each directory in this project.

## High-level principles
- data/ and outputs/ are runtime artifacts and are NOT version-controlled
- src/ contains reusable library code only
- scripts/ are execution entry points (keep minimal; HPC + main runners)
- docs/ are the source of truth for methodology and decisions
- EFNY-specific assumptions live in configs/paths.yaml (dataset section) and docs/workflow.md
- reusable data live under data/processed; run artifacts live under outputs
- docs/README.md is the index for the documentation set

## Directory responsibilities

- src/
  Reusable Python modules. No hard-coded paths. No dataset-specific logic.
  - imaging_preprocess/: rs-fMRI preprocessing, QC, and functional connectivity utilities
  - behavioral_preprocess/: behavioral data cleaning, task metrics, and summaries
  - models/: modeling and evaluation utilities
  - result_summary/: result aggregation and reporting utilities

- scripts/
  Execution entry points. May parse config and dataset arguments.

- configs/
  Centralized configuration files.
  - paths.yaml: repository paths and dataset-specific settings (single dataset section)
  - analysis.yaml: modeling and evaluation defaults
  - behavioral_metrics.yaml: task-level metric definitions and downstream metric selection

- data/
  Raw and processed datasets. Never modified by git.
  - external/: third-party inputs not produced by the pipeline
  - raw/: original inputs (not produced by pipeline scripts)
  - interim/: intermediate derivatives
  - processed/: reusable, cleaned outputs

- outputs/
  Run artifacts (results, figures, logs). Not tracked by git.
  - figures/: figures generated by pipeline scripts
  - logs/: runtime logs (script logs, SLURM stdout/stderr)
  - results/: results generated by pipeline scripts
  - tables/: tables generated by pipeline scripts

- notebooks/
  Exploratory analysis notebooks. Not tracked by git.

- models/
  Serialized model artifacts. Not tracked by git.

- docs/
  Human- and AI-readable documentation.
  - README.md: index of documentation files
  - workflow.md: reproducible pipeline
  - methods.md: paper-level methodology
  - reports/: research planning and summaries
  - sessions/: AI/development session logs (one file per day, organized by yy/mm/dd.md)
  - notes/: user notes and free-form ideas
